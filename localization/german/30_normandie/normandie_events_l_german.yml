Proving [william.GetHerHis] strength, the anarchy was brought to an end.\n\nNot too long ago, the king of $k_england$, Edward 'the Confessor', died without an heir. Since [william.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was his first cousin once removed, [william.GetSheHe] claimed the throne, built a large fleet and invaded the island along with [william.GetHerHis] $norman$ knights.\n\n[william.GetHerHis|U] conquest was successful, but rebellions are sure to follow."
