At the age of 17, [hassan.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] converted to [GetFaithByKey('imami').GetName] and studied languages, astronomy and mathematics among other things. At the age of 27, [hassan.GetSheHe] took off on a pilgrimage to $b_cairo$, where [hassan.GetSheHe] studied to become a missionary.\n\nAfter returning to $k_persia$, [hassan.GetSheHe] was arrested for supporting Nizar as the next Caliph. Due to an omen, [hassan.GetSheHe] was released from prison and started preaching [GetFaithByKey('nizari').GetName] in the $persian$ mountains.\n\nSeeking a safe stronghold to operate his preachings from, [hassan.GetSheHe] eventually found the castle of [hassan.GetCapitalLocation.GetName]. Thanks to meticulous planning, it was captured without much violence after two years."
