 jabalid_invasion.1001.desc:0 "[sinan.GetShortUINameNoTooltip] - also known as 'Old Man of the Mountain' - was born in $b_basra$ [sinan.GetAge] years ago. After having a fallout with [sinan.GetHerHis] brothers, [sinan.GetSheHe] left for the $persian$ [GetFaithByKey('nizari').GetAdherentName] assassins in $b_alamut$.\n\nLater in life, [sinan.GetSheHe] was sent to $k_syria$ to lead the assassins there with considerable autonomy. From there, he asserted pressure on the $e_ayyubid$ as well as the kingdom of $k_jerusalem$ which was established in the wake of the third crusade.\n\nThough attempting to take Saladin's life numerous times, [sinan.GetSheHe] never succeeded in doing so. After a close call during the siege of $b_masyaf$, Saladin allied himself with [sinan.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] against the crusaders.\n\nKing Conrad Montferrat of $k_jerusalem$ is believed to be assassinated on [sinan.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s orders."
